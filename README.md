In this section, the **remote desktop** has been created and it is from this VM that we will start working with the VPN environment.  We went to www.protonvpn.com to create an account.  Once the account has been created, we must download the ProtonVPN client and install in on the remote desktop session  that you created.

### Create an Account with www.ProptonVPN.com
